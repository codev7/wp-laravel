 | First, we will load all of the "core" dependencies for Spark which are
 | libraries such as Vue and jQuery. Then, we will load the components
 | which manage the Spark screens such as the user settings screens.
 |
 | Next, we will create the root Vue application for Spark. We'll only do
 | this if a "spark-app" ID exists on the page. Otherwise, we will not
 | attempt to create this Vue application so we can avoid conflicts.
