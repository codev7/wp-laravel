					<p><strong>...Sound familiar?</strong></p>


					<img src="{{ asset('images/img-10.png') }}" alt="WordPress Concierge" alt="" class="pull-right" />

					<p>You spent a lot of time and money designing and developing the WordPress site for your business.  Since your website is the main entry point for your customers, it is important to keep it up to date, fresh, and most importantly, not have any downtime that would prevent your customers from using your product.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">But...<br /><br />"my in house developers hate making updates for me on my marketing site"</h3>


					<p>We get it!  The WordPress marketing site you all built is not your core business, and your developers would rather being doing the important stuff (and the job they were hired to do) - building and improving your company's product.</p>


					<p>Even if your WordPress theme is perfect, it still requires regular maintenance.  Also, sometimes you want to be able to just update a photo on your home page, or add your new employee, Diane, to your about us page.</p>



					<p>Stop worrying about maintaining and updating your company's WordPress site and try a Code My Views concierge package.</p>

						<q>"Working with the team at Code My Views is not only productive, it's a joy.  I know that all my WordPress needs are in good hands each month, and their downtime detection software seems to work great because our site is never down.  It also is nice knowing that I can rely on them to make quick changes to our site."</q>

					<h3 class="text-center">Imagine if all of your WordPress site updates just got done like magic</h3>

					<div class="pull-right scale-down">

					</div><!--pull-right-->

					

					<p>Unfortunately, no theme is perfect.  Bugs come up, plugins needs to be updated, and most importantly, you need to keep your site looking fresh and up to date.</p>

					<p>This stuff is all to be expected for any business that uses their website as an entry point for their customers.  A Concierge plan with Code My Views will give you the flexibility to make as many updates to your site that you need, and also the security that your site is updated and won't experience any down time.</p>

					<h5 class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-magic fa-4x text-primary"></i></h5>

					<p>Like so many other businesses that used an agency or contractor to build their WordPress site,  you've probably had a hard time getting updates done to your site after the final payment was sent.  And your in house developers don't want to touch the WordPress site.</p>

					
					<p>You could find another freelancer to help with your ongoing site updates but finding a good WordPress freelance developer is tough when there are a sea of "developers" who will do nothing but hack up your site and leave you in worse shape than you started.<p>

					<h3><i class="fa fa-frown-o text-primary"></i> This doesn't sound like very much fun!</h3>

					<p>It's time to get back to you what you are supposed to be doing.  You need a professional who can be your trusted resource to take care of your WordPress site so your team doesn't have to worry about it anymore.</p>

					<p>All of your WordPress site updates, text changes, plugin updates, everything in between, whatever you need - all done.</p>

					<p>Without having to lift a finger, or file another ticket with your internal dev team, or having to try to figure it out yourself.</p>

					<p>Here are some sample tasks you can rely on Code My Views Concierge for:</p>
